## Contributing

In OPS4J, everyone is invited to contribute. We don't require any paperwork or community reputation.
All we ask you is to move carefully and to clean up after yourself: 

* Describe your problem or enhancement request before submitting a solution.
* Submit a JIRA issue before creating a pull request. This is required for the release notes.
* For discussions, the mailing list is more suitable than JIRA.
* Any bugfix or new feature must be covered by regression tests.
* Respect the coding style and formatting conventions of existing sources. There is an Eclipse
formatter in `assets/EclipseJavaFormatter.xml`.
